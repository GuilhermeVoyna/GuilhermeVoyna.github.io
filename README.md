Welcome to My Awesome Project! This is a simple web application with both client and server components. Follow the instructions below to get it up and running.

## Running the Client

The client-side of this project runs on port 3000. To start the client application, open your terminal and navigate to the "client" directory, and run the following command:

cd client
npm run start

This will start the client application, and you can access it in your web browser at "http://localhost:3000."

## Running the Server

The server-side of this project runs on port 8000. To start the server, open another terminal window, navigate to the "server" directory, and run the following command:

cd server
npm run start:backend

This will start the server, and it will be accessible at "http://localhost:8000."

That's it! You now have both the client and server components of My Awesome Project up and running. Enjoy your development!
